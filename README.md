## What's this?

My portfolio page. It's a simple page with a contact form, a small blog, and a projects section. From there, you can visit all other relevant links.

## Tech Stack

The site uses:

-   React
-   Gatsby as a frontend framework
-   Sanity as a CMS
-   Styled Components for styling
-   Netlify Serverless Functions for handling E-Mail
-   And a couple of smaller modules such as react-hook-form, reatct-markdown, date-fns and all that good stuff.
